# Test Plan

> The Test Plan communicates the testing approach throughout the engagement, to all participants. This document is bound to evolve in time, with an iterative definition that gets refined upon need, but where the higher-level definition is given as soon as possible. This test Plan can thus be used at all stages of the project in particular to validate the feasibility of the testing, hence of delivery the expected results. For more information see the [Test Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_plan).
